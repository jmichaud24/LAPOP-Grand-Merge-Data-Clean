This is a cleaned subset of the LAPOP 2004-2023 Grand Merge data file. It includes responses to the Americas Barometer survey from eight Latin American countries collected between 2010 and 2023. 
The subset includes recoded country names and ordered factor variables for respondent answers to questions about political and economic views.
I, John Michaud, downloaded the data from the LAPOP Americas Barometer database and created the subset described above.
